<P> This outfit is fantastic for the cold weater heading our way. It's simple with the black and grey but still fashionable. The black boots will do well with the snow that is currently falling. You can also add accessories such as the black watch and black phonecase shown.</P>

<P>This is an awesome outfit for church. The light beige color is simple and the bergandy is a great accent. The floral pattern is great with the matching purse. You can add a simple watch or headband to it. </P>

<P>This is a great comfy outfit for a relaxing day. A simple jean skirt with a simple hoodie. You could put any shirt underneath the hoodie leaving plenty of options. Along with some Tom's shoes.
