<H1>My Apostolic Life</H1>
<P> Here you will find my blog! I want to share my walk with God with everyone around me and hopefully touch everyone the same way I have been touched. Being Apostolic is the best decision I have ever made in my life and there is no other way I would want it to be. I will try to update you guys daily! Hope you can get moved by God through me!</p>
<H2>The Apostolic Way</H1>
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Acts 2:38 "Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." As Apostolics we live by this scripture. In order for us to be saved we must repent everyday, get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and receive in the gift of the Holy Ghost.</LI> </P>
<LI> I Corinthians 11:15 " But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering." I take pride in my long hair as for God allows me to use it as my covering.

<P>Today there was an amazing move of the Holy Ghost at Old Town. It was youth sunday and as usual we have a guest speaker. Our song service was amazing and was possibly one of the longest ones we have had yet. God really touched the youth today and blessed us with his word.</p>

<p>Started the morning off right with a little bible reading. I've started to keep a journal of my bible readings and take note on anything I seem to find important. Hoping that God does amazing things today and shows what he can really do. Wishing you all a fantastic day!</P>
