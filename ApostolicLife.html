<H1>My Apostolic Life</H1>
<P> Here you will find my blog! I want to share my walk with God with everyone around me and hopefully touch everyone the same way I have been touched. Being Apostolic is the best decision I have ever made in my life and there is no other way I would want it to be. I will try to update you guys daily! Hope you can get moved by God through me!</p>
<H2>The Apostolic Way</H1>
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Acts 2:38 "Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." As Apostolics we live by this scripture. In order for us to be saved we must repent everyday, get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and receive in the gift of the Holy Ghost.</LI> </P>
